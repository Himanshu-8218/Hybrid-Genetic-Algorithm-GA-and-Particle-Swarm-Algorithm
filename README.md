# Hybrid-Genetic-Algorithm-GA-and-Particle-Swarm-Algorithm
This project implements a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both algorithms to find optimal solutions to complex optimization problems.

Genetic Algorithm (GA):

Population Initialization: A population of potential solutions is generated randomly.
Selection: Selects the fittest individuals for reproduction.
Crossover: Combines pairs of individuals to produce offspring.
Mutation: Introduces random changes to individuals to maintain genetic diversity.
Replacement: Replaces the old population with the new one.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):

Initialization: A swarm of particles is initialized with random positions and velocities.
Velocity Update: Adjusts the velocity of each particle based on its own experience and that of its neighbors.
Position Update: Updates the position of each particle according to its new velocity.
Personal Best and Global Best: Tracks the best solution found by each particle and the overall best solution found by the swarm.

Hybrid Approach
The hybrid algorithm alternates between GA and PSO steps. The GA step enhances global exploration, while the PSO step refines local exploitation. This combination helps in efficiently navigating the search space.
